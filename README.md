# hangman
A quick hangman game I made. Uses file input, so be sure to open the README.
README:
This program uses file streams. The words.txt document holds the words used in the game.
The first number is the number of words in the document, and the rest are the words.
You can add your own words or make your own words document. Just remember to account for 
the number of words at the beginning of the document.

***IMPORTANT***
This program was made using VisualStudio. If you use VisualStudio to run it, in the tool bar 
you have to go to project > Hangman properties. Then under configuartion properties, 
select Debugging and type words.txt in Command Arguments to open the file.
